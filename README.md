My process was to scaffold the project, create the Laravel API Endpoints, create a layout, and then style the layout. Creating the endpoints and fetching the data was easy; the more challenging bit was to create a design that made sense. Initially, I wanted to have the portfolio follow this design https://talent.foam.org/ , but I didn't have the time to implement it for the week. Instead, I went with a split page and a monochrome look. It's simple, but I think it still does the job of putting the focus on the photographer's details and his photography.
  
I used Laravel for the Back-end, Vue 2 for the Front-end, and no style library was used. I used Vue 2 rather than Vue 3 simply because I'm more comfortable and faster with it. And I didn't use a style library because I didn't need a ton of the options that something like bootstrap provides, which created a more compact stylesheet in the end.
